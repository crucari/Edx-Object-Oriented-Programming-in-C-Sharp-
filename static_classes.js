//A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
//To create a static class, you use the static keyword.
//Any members within the class must also use the static keyword, as shown in the following example:

// Static Classes
public static class Conversions
{
   public static double PoundsToKilos(double pounds)
   {
      // Convert argument from pounds to kilograms
      double kilos = pounds * 0.4536;
      return kilos;
   }
   public static double KilosToPounds(double kilos)
   {
      // Convert argument from kilograms to pounds
      double pounds = kilos * 2.205;
      return pounds;
   }
}

//To call a method on a static class, you call the method on the class name itself instead of on an instance name, as shown by the following example:

//Calling Methods on a Static Class
double weightInKilos = 80;
double weightInPounds = Conversions.KilosToPounds(weightInKilos);

// To declare a static member you use the static keyword before the return type of the member, as shown by the following example:

// Static Members in Non-static Classes
public class DrinksMachine
{
   public int Age { get; set; }
   public string Make { get; set; }
   public string Model { get; set; }
   public static int CountDrinksMachines()
   {
      // Add method logic here.
   }
}

//Regardless of how many instances of your class exist, there is only ever one instance of a static member.
//You do not need to instantiate the class in order to use static members.
//You access static members through the class name rather than the instance name, as shown by the following example:

// Access Static Members
int drinksMachineCount = DrinksMachine.CountDrinksMachines();

anAnonymousObject = new { Name = "Tom", Age = 65 };

var anAnonymousObject = new { Name = "Tom", Age = 65 };

Console.WriteLine("Name: {0} Age: {1}", anAnonymousObject.Name, anAnonymousObject.Age};

var secondAnonymousObject = new { Name = "Hal", Age = 46 };

secondAnonymousObject = anAnonymousObject;
